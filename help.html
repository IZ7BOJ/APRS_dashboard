    <p>This Dashboard was developed in order to get a real-time situation of the Apulian Aprs Digipeaters and I-Gate, in terms of operability on both RF and APRS-IS side."<br>
       The dashboard can be useful for both sysops and users, in order to track and understand technical problems on the network<br>
	The dashboard is based on aprs.fi database. Every time the page is opened or refreshed, a query to the aprs.fi database is performed, for every station under control.<br>
	For every station, the "last heard" time and the path is obtained and processed, then the following data are shown on the page:<br>
	- Vitality: if the last heard packet is older than a timeout set by the administrator, then the station is declared "Dead"<br>
	- Path: in this column, you can read if the packet is heard via RF, by another digi, or directly via TPC-IP <br></p>
